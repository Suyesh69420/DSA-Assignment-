# Q5 — Undirected Graph (Adjacency Matrix) with BFS & DFS

## Representation
- `adj[V][V]` adjacency matrix (0/1 entries).

## Functions
- `runBFS(adj, start)` — queue-based BFS.
- `runDFS(adj, start)` — uses `dfsRec` recursion for DFS.

## main()
- Demonstrates BFS and DFS on a sample 5-node graph.

## Sample Output
BFS starting from 0: 0 1 2 3 4 
DFS starting from 0: 0 1 2 4 3
