# DSA-Assignment-
General Coding Method
For each problem:

Commit 1 — Skeleton Commit

Creating the file prog_<q>.c with only the basic structure:

#include statements

main() function
No real implementation  is shown in this commit , just the scaffolding,this works  as  a blueprint for the program  about to run 

Purpose: Show the initial setup of the program and the functions necessary for the program

Commit 2 — Core Logic Commit

Implementation of the core algorithm in the simplest way possible.

Using minimal variable names and direct logic.

input/output formatting isnt done yet.

Purpose: Get the program working in the raw form.

Commit 3 — Finalized Commit

Improve code readability:

Meaningful variable names (subtle but descriptive)

Better formatting

Adding function decomposition (move logic into functions)

Adding final input/output handling.
